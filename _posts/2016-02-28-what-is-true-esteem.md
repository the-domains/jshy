# **What is True Esteem?**

We're all striving for healthy self-esteem. Healthy self-esteem is the cornerstone of happiness, confidence, and serenity. However, those with too much self-esteem or those who have not built their self-esteem correctly may have a tendency to be self-centered and narcissistic.

Self-Esteem can be an elusive concept and difficult to attain without help from someone who understands it, and has grown in it himself.

At True Esteem Coaching, I help my clients develop the healthy self-esteem they are looking for, but not twisted with arrogance and an inflated ego. I assist in developing a_True Esteem_that is based on the solid foundations of humility and gratitude.
